# Tembiu App Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Tembiu - Card√°pio Digital Open Source project.

## Overview

Tembiu ([tem-bi-'u]) is a Tupi-Guarani word meaning "food." This project aims to be the first free and complete open-source digital menu solution with native PIX and WhatsApp Business integration, tailored for Brazilian restaurants. Our mission is to democratize gastronomic technology.

This documentation will guide you through setting up, configuring, using, and contributing to the Tembiu app.
